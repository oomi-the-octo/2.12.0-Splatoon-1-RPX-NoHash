# Splatoon-1-RPX-NoHash
[READ THIS BEFORE INJECTING IT.] 
**THIS IS ONLY FOR 2.12.0**

Permanent No-Hash edit on RPX, works for Wii U and Cemu.
This was tested, it does not ban on Nintendo Network and also does not kick you in a match.
DO NOT USE ANY HIDDEN GEAR OR HIDDEN WEAPONS : This is just for No Hash, it doesn't allow you to use hidden gear/weapons safely online.

I am not responsable if you get banned while using it. You must have used a edited Static.pack mod that might have being risky to use. 
(ex : Hidden Gear, or Hidden Weapons, etc...)

PLEASE USE ANY OTHER NOHASH PATCHES THAN THIS.
