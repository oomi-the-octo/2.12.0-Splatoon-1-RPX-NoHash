# Splatoon-1-RPX-NoHash
[READ THIS BEFORE INJECTING IT.] 
Permanent No-Hash edit on RPX, works for Wii U and Cemu.
This was tested, it does not ban on Nintendo Network and also does not kick you in a match. Except if you use risky edits (such as hidden gear)

I am not responsable if you get banned while using it. You must have used a edited Static.pack mod that might have being risky to use. 
(ex : Hidden Gear, or Hidden Weapons, etc...)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This RPX is EUR only, i have no idea if it works for JP or US.

Place the file at : 

If using a USB storage which you put Splatoon in : Storage_usb\usr\title\0005000e\10176a00\code

If using the WiiU which you put Splatoon in : Storage_mlc\usr\title\0005000e\10176a00\code

Once you done that, boot Splatoon, if you see "Ver. NoHash" it means it patched successfully! ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99236152/208328047-557e4689-ea55-4e38-afd0-83202f321b69.png)
