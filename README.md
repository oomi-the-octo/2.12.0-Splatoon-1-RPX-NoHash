# Splatoon-1-RPX-NoHash
Permanent No-Hash edit on RPX, works for Wii U and Cemu.
This was tested, it does not ban on Nintendo Network and also does not kick you in a match.

I am not responsable if you get banned while using it. You must have used a edited Static.pack mod that might have being risky to use (ex : Hidden Gear, or Hidden Weapons, etc...)
